        <p>
          After the time of the Noble Prophet ( صلى الله عليه وسلم ) came the
          era of the Great Sahabah and the Rightly Guided Caliphs. This period
          lasted from 11 to 40 AH (632 CE - 662 CE). Qurra' (The Reciters) was
          the term used at the time to denote those Sahabah who had a good
          understanding of Fiqh and gave Fatwa (Religious Decree/ Legal Verdict,
          plural: Fatawa).

        <strong>
          <h4>a. THE TIME OF ABU BAKR AL-SIDDIQUE (رضي الله عنه)</h4>
        </strong>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Whenever a dispute was referred to him, Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) used
          to look in the Qur'an; If he could not find a solution in the Qur'an,
          but remembered some relevant aspect of the Prophet's Sunnah, he would
          judge according to that. If he could find nothing in the Sunnah, he
          would go and say to the Muslims: 'Such and such a dispute has been
          referred to me. Do any of you know anything in the Prophet's ( صلى
          الله عليه وسلم ) Sunnah according to which judgment may be passed?'.
          If someone was able to answer his question and provide relevant
          information, Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) would say: 'Praise be to ALLAH
          Who has enabled some of us to remember what they have learnt from our
          Prophet ( صلى الله عليه وسلم ). If he could not find any solution in
          the Sunnah, then he would gather the leaders and elite of the people
          and consult with them. If they agreed on a matter then he passed
          judgment on that basis. If all the methods mentioned above failed to
          produce any result, then he would make Ijtihad and form his own
          opinion, either by interpreting a text in such a way as its legal
          implications became apparent, or by exercising his own legal acumen.

          The most noticeable feature of 'Umar's methodology, however, is the
          fact that he often consulted the Sahabah and discussed matters with
          them so as to reach the best understanding and find the most
          appropriate way to carry out judgments. Ibn Mas'ud (رضي الله عنه) said
          of him, "whatever path 'Umar chose, we found it easy to follow."

          Othman ibn Affan (رضي الله عنه) was one of the Sahabah who did not
          produce a great number of Fatawa, probably because most of the matters
          he came across had already been dealt with by Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه)
          and Umar (رضي الله عنه), and he preferred to adopt their opinions. But
          in some cases, he had to make Ijtihad, just as his predecessors had
          done. One Major Ijtihad of Othman ibn Affan (رضي الله عنه) was the
          Standardisation of writing the Qur'an in the Recitation Dialect of
          Quresh Tribe.

        <p className="mt-2">
          Prior to his assuming the office of Caliphe, Ali ibn Abi Talib (رضي
          الله عنه) was considered the best judge in Madinah. When the Prophet (
          صلى الله عليه وسلم ) appointed 'Ali (رضي الله عنه) judge in Yemen, He
          ( صلى الله عليه وسلم ) prayed for him, saying: "O' LORD! Guide his
          heart and make him speak the truth." Indeed, 'Ali (رضي الله عنه)
          proved to be an excellent judge, and resolved many difficult cases.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Ali used to formulate his own opinion by means of Ijtihad, always
          basing his opinion on the broader aims of the Sharī'ah. Ali (رضي الله
          عنه) described his own knowledge by saying: "By ALLAH, no verse of the
          Qur'an was ever revealed except that I knew concerning what it was
          revealed, and where and why it was revealed. My LORD has bestowed upon
          me a heart that is understanding and a tongue that is articulate."

          Al-Ijma' was also widely used as a basis for judgment. This was
          facilitated by the fact that the Sahabah were few, and it was easy for
          them to agree amongst themselves.

          Although the primary sources i.e the Qur'an, the Sunnah, al-Ijma' and

          differed in many aspects from what had gone before. Among the more
          significant changes were the following:
        </p>
        <strong>
          <h4 className="mt-2">a.</h4>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Scholars had become more interested in delving into what lay beyond
          the explicit meanings of the texts.

        <strong>
          <h4 className="mt-2">b.</h4>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Their ways of dealing with the Sunnah underwent a great deal of
          change. Essentially, this difference was the outcome of political
          differences that accompanied the emergence of various sectarian and
          philosophical factions, such as the Shi'ah and Khawarij, whose
          attitude to the Sunnah was different.
        </p>
        <strong>
          <h4 className="mt-2">c.</h4>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Owing to the divisions which had arisen, al Ijma' was no longer a
          possibility in this period. Basically, this was because every group
          mistrusted the scholars of every other group, and would no longer
          accept any of their opinions, whether they agreed or disagreed with
          them. In addition, the Fuqaha (singuler:- Fa'qeh, means, Jurists) from
          among the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) had become scattered all over the
          Islamic world, so that it was no longer possible for them to meet in
          order to discuss matters.

        <strong>
          <h4 className="mt-2">d.</h4>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Also in this period, the narration of Hadith and Sunnah became
          popular, whereas this had not previously been the case.

          'Ikramah, the freed man of Ibn 'Abbas; 'Ata' ibn Rabah, the Faqih of

          Faqih of Kufah; Hasan al Basri, the Faqih of Basrah; Ibn Sirin, also
          of Basrah; 'Ata' al Khurasani in Khurasan, and others. These Tabi'un
          very rarely altered the Fatawa of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) from
          whom they had gained their knowledge; hence it is difficult to find
          differences between their methods of deriving judgements and those of

          Among the significant features of this period was the emergence of
          differences of opinion between legal scholars on a variety of matters.
          Umayyad Caliphe of the times, 'Umar ibn 'Abd al 'Aziz, noticed it and
          issued orders as follows: "Look for whatever Hadith of the Prophet
          (صلى الله عليه وسلم), or Sunnah, or practice you can find. Then write
          these down for me; for I fear that this knowledge will pass away with
          the passing of the scholars". Accordingly, the people of every
          locality wrote down in books whatever they knew to be a part of the
          Sunnah. Moreover, he also restricted the authority to issue Fatwa, in
          most districts, to a few named individuals.

          This period was described by Wali Allah al-Dahlawi as follows: "The
          Fuqaha' of the period took the Hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه
          وسلم), the decisions of the early judges, and the legal scholarship of
          the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم), the Tabi'un and the third generation, and
          then produced their own Ijtihad.

          <h4 className="mt-2">a.</h4>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Such opinions were actually Hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)
          which had been narrated by one of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) or the
          Tabi'un who had, for fear of misquoting, not dared to attribute the

          Allah ibn 'Abbas (May ALLAH be pleased with them). The school of Ahl
          Al Hadith became widespread in the Hijaz. Famous Sab'a Fuq'ha Madinah
          (Seven Jurists of Madinah) i.e Urwa bin Zubayr, Abu Bakr bin Abd

        <p>
          The scholars of this group thought that legal interpretations of the
          Sharī'ah should have a basis in reason, should take into account the
          best interests of the people, and should be backed by discernible
          wisdom. Indeed, these scholars felt it their duty to uncover these
          meanings and the wisdom behind the laws. The spread of this method in
          Iraq was helped by the number of Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) influenced by
          the methods of 'Umar ibn Khattab (رضي الله عنه). Among them were Ibn
          Mas'ud, Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, 'Imran ibn Husayn, Anas ibn Malik, Ibn
          Abbas and others (May ALLAH be pleased with them). The spread was also
          assisted by the transfer of the Caliphate to Iraq, by 4th Righteous
          Caliphe Ali ibn Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه).

        <p>
          During the era of prophethood, the foundations of Fiqh were laid down
          in the Prophet Muhammad's (صلى الله عليه وسلم) Ijtihad (reasoned
          rulings), as well as those of Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم). In other words,
          there was only one school of thought (Madh'hab): that of the Prophet
          (صلى الله عليه وسلم).

        </strong>
        <p>
          In the era of the Righteous Caliphs, the Fiqh principle of Ijma'
          (Consensus, Decisions by Unanimity) evolved and Ijtihad became an
          independent principle of Fiqh under the name, Qiyas. The Madh'hab
          during this period was, in reality, that of each of the Righteous
          Caliphs, since the final say in legal matters rested with them.
          However, all legal decisions were subject to alteration on the basis
          of recorded Hadiths and Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).

          </h4>
        </strong>
        <p>
          The early period of the Umayyad dynasty saw the division of Fiqh
          scholars into two main Madh'habs with respect to Ijtihad: Ahl
          Al-Hadith and Ahl Al-Ra'i. These two Madh'habs evolved into a number
          of new Madhhabs during the shift from caliphate to monarchy when the
          caliph/king was no longer the head of the Madh'hab. However, that
          during both the period of the Umayyads and that of the early
          'Abbasids, students of Fiqh freely and frequently changed teachers and
          exchanged legal opinions. In effect, therefore, the flexibility of the
          previous periods was maintained.

        </strong>
        <p>
          Since the turn of Caliphate into Monarchy of Umayyads, the traditional
          role of Caliphate in respect of Fiqh was considerably reduced.
          Consequently, common Muslims started approaching to Scholars of their
          cities to get the Fiqh based solution to personal Sharī'ah related
          questions. Hence, different schools of thought started emerging from
          late first century Hijra through second and third century Hijra. Most
          famous Fuqa'ha in that era were Imam Malik ibn Anas, Imam Abu Hanifah,
          Imam Hasan Al Basri, Imam Muhammad bin Idrees Al Shafi'i, Imam Sufyan
          thawri, Imam Ma'rof Al Karakhi, Imam Awza'i, Imam Laith ibn Saad and
          Imam Ahmed ibn Hunbal. But by the third century Hijra only four
          Madh'habs survived.

          </p>
          <p>
            Qur'an to be the primary unquestionable source of Islamic law. In
            fact, it was used to determine the accuracy of the other sources.
            Accordingly, any other source that contradicted the Qur'an was
            considered inaccurate.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>b) THE SUNNAH</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The Sunnah was consulted as the second most important source of
            Islamic law, but with some qualification as to its use. They
            stipulated that it was not sufficient that a Hadith to be Authentic
            (Sahih), but it had to be also widely known (Mash'hoor), if it was
            to be used as a legal proof. This condition was laid down as a
            safeguard against false hadiths which were cropping up frequently in
            that region where only a few notable Sahabah had settled (Ali ibn
            Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه) and Abd Allah Ibn Mas'ood (رضي الله عنه).
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>c) IJMA' (CONSENSUS)OF THE SAHABAH (رضي الله عنهم)</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Third in importance as a source of Islamic law was the unanimous
            opinion of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) on any point of law not
            specified in the Qur'an or the Sunnah. That is, Ijma of Sahabah (رضي
            الله عنهم) was given precedence over the personal opinions of Abu
            Hanifah and his students in their deduction of Islamic law. The
            Hanafi Madh'hab also recognized the Ijma of Muslim scholars in any
            age as valid and binding on Muslims.

            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If there were different opinions among the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم)
            on a particular point of law and no Ijma' was subsequently formed,
            Abu Hanifah would choose the opinion which appeared most appropriate
            to the case in question. In establishing this as a vital principle
            of his Madh'hab, Abu Hanifah again gave more weight to the opinions
            of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) than to his own. However, he did
            apply his own reasoning in a limited sense by choosing one of their
            various opinions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>e) QIYAS (ANALOGICAL DEDUCTION)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Abu Hanifah felt no obligation to accept the deductions of the
            students of the Sahabah (Tabi'un) in areas where no clear proof was
            available from any of the above mentioned sources. He considered
            himself the equal of the Tabi'un and would make his own Ijtihad
            based on the principles of Qiyas which he and his students
            established.

            <strong>f) ISTIHSAN (PREFERENCE)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Istihsan, in short, is the preference of one proof over another
            proof because it appears more suitable to the situation, even though
            the preferred proof may be technically weaker than the one it is
            preferred to. This may involve the preference of a hadith which is
            specific over a general one, or it may even involve the preference
            of a more suitable law over the one deduced by Qiyas.

            <strong>g) URF (LOCAL CUSTOM)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Local customs were given legal weight in areas where there were no
            binding Islamic customs available. It was through the application of
            this principle that various customs found in the multiplicity of
            cultures within the Islamic world entered the legal system and
            became mistakenly classified as Islamic.

          ThThe founding scholar of this Madh'hab, Malik ibn Anas ibn Amir, was
          born in Madinah in the year 717 CE. His grandfather, Amir, was among
          the major Sahabah of Madinah. Malik studied hadith under Al'Zuhri who
          was the greatest hadith scholar of his time, as well as under the
          great Hadith narrator, Naffi', the freed slave of the Sahabi Abdullah
          ibn Umar (May Allah be pleased with them). His followers were referred

        <p className="md:pl-4 mt-2">
          Imam Malik deduced Islamic law from the following sources which are
          listed in the order of their importance.
        </p>
        <div className="md:ml-10 ">
          <p>
            <strong>a) THE QUR'AN</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Like all the other Imams Malik considered the Qur'an to be the
            primary source of Islamic law and utilized it without laying any
            pre- conditions for its application.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>b) THE SUNNAH</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The Sunnah was used by Imam Malik as the second most important
            source of Islamic law, but, like Abu Hanifah, he put some
            restrictions on its use. If a hadith were contradicted by the
            customary practice of the Madinites, he rejected it. He did not,
            however, insist that a Hadith be Mash'hoor (widely known) before it
            could be applied as Abu Hanifah did. Instead, he used any Hadith
            that was narrated to him as long as none of the narrators were known
            liars or extremely weak memorizers.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>c) AMAL (PRACTICES) OF THE MADINITES</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Imam Malik reasoned that since many of the Madinites were direct
            descendants of the Sahabah and Madinah was where the Prophet (صلى
            الله عليه وسلم) spent the last ten years of his life, practices
            common to all Madinites must have been allowed, if not encouraged by
            the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) himself. Thus, Imam Malik regarded
            common Madinite practices as a form of highly authentic Sunnah
            narrated in deeds rather than words.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>d) IJMA OF THE SAHABAH (رضي الله عنهم)</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Malik like Abu Han if ah considered the ljma of the Sahabah, as well
            as that of later scholars, as the third most important source of
            Islamic law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>
              e) INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS OF THE SAHABAH (رضي الله عنهم)
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Imam Malik gave full weight to the opinions of the Sahabah (رضي الله
            عنهم), whether they were conflicting or in agreement, and included
            them in his book of Hadith, Al Muwatta. However, the consensus of
            the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) was given precedence over individual
            opinions of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم). Where there was no
            consensus, their individual opinions were given precedence over his
            own opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>f) QIYAS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Malik used to apply his own deductive reasoning on matters not
            covered by the previously mentioned sources. However, he was very
            cautious about doing so because of the subjectivity of such forms of
            reasonings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>g) CUSTOMS OF THE MADINITES</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Imam Malik also gave some weight to isolated practices found among a
            few people of Madinah so long as they were not in contradiction to
            known Hadiths. He reasoned that such customs, though occurring only
            in isolated instances, must also have been handed down from earlier
            generations and sanctioned by the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) or even
            the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>h) ISTISLAH (WELFARE)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The principle of lstihsan developed by Abu Hanifah was also applied
            by Malik and his students except that they called it by the name
            lstislah which simply means seeking that which is more suitable. It
            deals with things which are for human welfare but have not been
            specifically considered by the Shari'ah. An example of lstislah is
            found in Caliph 'Ali's ruling that a whole group of people who took
            part in a murder were guilty even though only one of the group had
            actually committed the act of murder. The legal texts of Shari'ah
            covered only the actual murderer. Another example is the right of a
            Muslim leader to collect taxes from the rich other than Zakah if the
            interest of the state demands it, whereas in Shari'ah only Zakah has
            been specified. Imam Malik also applied the principle of lstislah to
            deduce laws more in keeping with needs which arose from current
            situations than those deduced by Qiyas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>i) URF (CUSTOM)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Abu Hanifah, Malik considered the various customs and social
            habits of people throughout the Muslim world as possible sources of
            secondary laws as long as they did not contradict either the letter
            or the spirit of the Shari'ah. For example, according to custom in
            Syria, the word Dabbah means a horse, whereas its general meaning in
            Arabic is a four legged animal. Hence, a contract made in Syria
            requiring payment in the form of a Dabbah would legally mean a horse
            whereas elsewhere in the Arab world it would have to be more clearly
            defined as a horse.

          <h4 className="mt-2">i. THE FOUNDER: IMAM AL-SHAFI'I (769-820 CE)</h4>
        </strong>
        <p className="md:pl-4 mt-2">
          Imam Muhammad ibn ldrees al-Shafi'i was descendent of Mutalib the
          brother of Hashim the Great grandfather of Prophet (). Imam Shafi'i
          travelled to Madinah in his youth to study Fiqh and Hadith under Imam
          Malik, and remained under Malik until the latter died in 801CE. He
          studied for a while under Imam Muhammad Page 9 of 11 Ibn Al-Hassan,
          the famous student of Abu Hanifah. Later he travelled to Egypt to
          study the Madh'hab of al-Layth ibn Sa'ad from al-Layth's students.
          AI-Shafi'i remained in Egypt until his death in the year 820 CE.

          <h4 className="mt-2">ii. FORMATION OF THE SHAFI'I MADH'HAB</h4>
        </strong>
        <p className="md:pl-4 mt-2">
          Imam ash-Shafi'i combined the Fiqh of Hijaz (Maliki thought) with that
          of Iraq, (Hanafi thought) and created a new Madh'hab which he dictated
          to his students in the form of a book called al'Hujjah (The Evidence).
          This dictation took place in Iraq in the year 810 CE and a number of
          his students memorised his book and narrated it to others. This book
          and period of his scholarship are usually referred to as al'Madh'hab
          al'Qadeem (The Old School of Thought) to differentiate it from the
          second period of his scholarship which occurred after he reached
          Egypt. In Egypt he absorbed the Fiqh of Imam al-Layth ibn Sa'd and
          dictated al'Madh'hab al'Jadeed (The New School of Thought) to his
          students in the form of another book which he named al-Umm (The
          Essence). Because of his exposure to a completely new set of hadiths
          and legal reasoning, in al'Madh'hab al'Jadeed, he reversed many of the
          legal positions which he had held while in Iraq. Imam al-Shafi'i holds
          the distinction of being the first Imam to systematize the fundamental
          principles of Fiqh which he recorded in his book called AI-Risalah.

        <div className="md:ml-10">
          <p>
            <strong>a) THE QUR'AN</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            AI-Shafi'i did not differ from the previously mentioned Imams, in
            their uncompromising stand in relation to the primacy of the Qur'an
            among the sources of Islamic law. He relied on it as heavily as
            those before him adding only the new insights which he gained from a
            deep study of its meanings.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>b) THE SUNNAH</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            lmam ash-Shafi'i laid down only one conditions for the acceptance of
            Hadiths, namely that they be Authentic (Sahih). He rejected all the
            other conditions set by Imams, Abu Hanifah and Malik. He was also
            noted for his great contributions to the Science of Hadith
            Criticism.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>c) IJMA'</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Although al-Shafi'i had serious doubts about the possibility of the
            Ijma' in a number of cases, he conceded that in the few cases where
            it was known to have occurred, it should be regarded as the third
            most important source of Islamic law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>d) INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS OF THE SAHABAH</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Credence was given by Imam al-Shafi'i to the individual opinions of
            the Sahabah on condition that they were not at variance with each
            other. If there were conflicting opinions among the ~ahabah on a
            legal point, he, like Abu Hanifah, would choose whichever opinion
            was the closest to the source and leave the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>e) QIYAS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Qiyas was, in the Imam's opinion, a valid method for deducing
            further laws from the previous sources. However, he placed it last
            in order of importance, considering his personal opinions inferior
            to proofs based on the opinions of the Sahabah.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>f) LSTIS'HAAB (LINKING)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the principle lstihsan used by Abu Hanifah and lstislah used by
            Malik were rejected by al-Shafi'i and considered a form of Bid'ah
            (innovation), since, in his opinion, they were based mostly on human
            reasoning in areas where revealed laws already existed. However, in
            dealing with similar issues al-Shafi'i was Page 10 of 11 obliged to
            use a principle similar to lstihsan and lstislah which he called
            lstis'haab. lstis'haab literally means seeking a link, but legally
            it refers to the process of deducing Fiqh laws by linking a later
            set of circumstances with an earlier set. It is based on the
            assumption that the Fiqh laws applicable to certain conditions
            remain valid so long as it is not certain that these conditions have
            altered. If, for example, on account of the long absence of someone,
            it is doubtful whether he is alive or dead, then by lstis'hab all
            rules must remain in force which would hold if one knew for certain
            that he was still alive.

          </h4>
        </strong>
        <p className="md:pl-4 mt-2">
          Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal al-Shaybani was born in Baghdad in the year 778
          CE. He became one of the greatest memorizers and narrators of Hadith
          of his time. Concentrating on the study of Hadith, Ahmad studied Fiqh
          and Hadith sciences under Imam Abu Yosuf, the famous student of Abu
          Hanifah, as well as under Imam al-Shafi'i himself. Ahmad continued to
          teach in Baghdad until he died in the year 855 CE.

          <h4 className="mt-2">ii. FORMATION OF THE HANBALI MADH'HAB</h4>
        </strong>
        <p className="md:pl-4 mt-2">
          Imam Ahmad's greatest concern was the collection, narration, and
          interpretation of Hadith. His teaching method consisted of dictating
          Hadiths from his vast collection known as al-Musnad, which contained
          over 30,000 Hadiths, as well as the various opinions of the Sahabah
          concerning their interpretation. He would then apply the Hadiths or
          ruling to various existing problems. If he could not find a suitable
          Hadith or opinion to solve a problem, he would offer his own opinion
          while forbidding his students to record any of his own solutions. As a
          result, his Madh'hab was recorded, not by his students, but by their
          students.

        <div className="md:ml-10">
          <p>
            <strong>a) THE QUR'AN</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no difference between the way Ahmad ibn Hanbal approached
            Qur'an and that of those who preceded him. In other words, the
            Qur'an was given precedence over all else under all circumstances.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>b) THE SUNNAH</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Likewise, the Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) occupied
            the number two position among the fundamental principles used by the
            founder of this school in the deduction of laws. His only
            stipulation was that it be Mar'fu (Exalted/Elevated), i.e.
            attributed directly to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).

          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>c) IJMA' OF THE SAHABAH'</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Imam Ahmad recognized the consensus of opinion of the Sahabah (رضي
            الله عنهم), and placed it in the third position among the
            fundamental principles. However, he discredited the claims of ljma'
            outside the era of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) as being inaccurate,
            due to the vast number of scholars and their wide diffusion
            throughout the Muslim empire. In his opinion ljma' after the era of
            the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) was impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>d) INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS OF THE SAHABAH</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            lf a problem arose in an area where the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم) had
            expressed conflicting opinions, Ahmad, like Malik, would give
            credence to all the various individual opinions. Because of that,
            there developed within the Madh'hab many instances of multiple
            rulings for individual issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>e) DA'IF HADITH (WEAK HADITH)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            For a ruling on a case where none of the previous four principles
            offered a ready solution, the Imam used to prefer to use a weak
            hadith rather than applying his own deductive reasoning (Qiyas).
            However, this was on condition that the weakness of the hadith was
            not due to the fact that one of its narrators was classified as a
            Fasiq (Transgressor), or a Kadh'dhaab (liar).
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>f) QIYAS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            As a last resort, that is when no other major principle could be
            directly applied, Ahmad would reluctantly apply the principle of
            Qiyas and deduce a solution based on one or more of the previous
            principles.
