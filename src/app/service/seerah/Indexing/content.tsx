          pure arab environment of desert near Makkah with Banu Sa’ad a branch
          of Hawazin tribe. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم remained in Banu Sa’ad
          for five years. The miraculous event of “Shaq Sadr” (opening of the
          blessed chest by the Angles) also took place there. Angel cleaned the

          the grave of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, and to meet some relatives.
          On the way back the respected mother Sayyida Amina fell sick and
          passed away at the place of Abwa. The respected grandfather Abd
          al-Muttalib took over the guardianship of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.
          When the Prophet reached the age of eight, grandfather also passed
          away. Abd al Muttalib nominated Abu Talib, the real uncle of Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم , as guardian. The other real uncle Zubayr bin Abd
          al-Muttalib and half uncles also remained affectionate and caring

          trading. Married life brought happiness and peace. As far as religion
          and social life is concerned Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم since
          childhood neither liked nor followed polytheistic idol worshiping
          religion and rituals of the Quraysh. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          never participated in social activities involving drinking,
          womanizing, gambling, betting etc., rather Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          remained thinking and worried about the society's norms and rituals
          around. This sensitive nature of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم led Him to
          adopt seclusion by the age of late thirties. Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم started seclusion in Cave of Hira in a mountain besides Makkah,
          thinking about ALLAH یٰ تعال و سبحانہ , the God of Ibrahim السالم
          علیہ, the way of worshiping the one and only God and about law of "God

          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, after experiencing the strangest event,
          immediately returned home worrying for himself and asked Sayyida
          Khadija to cover Him up with mantle, then Prophetصلى الله عليه

          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم with following most beautiful words:

          "No, by Allah سبحانه وتعالى , Allah سبحانه وتعالى will never cause you

          charity to the needy, are hospitable to guests, and you carry out all

          her cousin Warqa bin Naufal who was an elderly scholar of Abrahamic
          religion and converted to Christianity from polytheism of Quraysh.
          Warqa testified that this was Archangel Gabriel, the verses he brought
          were the revelation from ALLAH سبحانه وتعالى and Muhammad صلى الله

          صلى الله عليه وسلم from preaching islam, or be ready to face the worst
          of consequences. The loving uncle Abu Talib, deeply worried, conveyed
          the message to Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          replied, that even if they put the sun on His one palm and the moon on
          the other, He will not cease the Prophetic mission until He succeeds
          or is martyred in its way. This reply touched the heart of the
          affectionate uncle. Abu Talib said that Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          should continue Prophetic mission and he will deal with the opponents
          at all cost.

          prosperous young man and hand them over Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم so
          they martyr Him. Abu Talib replied with anger and deep grief that your
          nephew enjoys life under me and my nephew would be assassinated by
          you? This is just not tolerable and can't be thought about. The
          Quraysh disbelievers after seeing conversion of Hamza ibn Abd
          al-Muttalib and Omer ibn Khattab, decide to make worldly offers to
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Utbah ibn Rabi'ah offered Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم the chiefship of Makkah and Quraysh, heaps of money and
          marriage with most beautiful Quraysh women as many as Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم like. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم turned down all the offers,
          and said, that ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ has directed Him to
          convey divine message; if they accept, it will be beneficial for both,
          this life and life hereafter, and if they reject than Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم will keep patience until ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ
          decides between Him and them. Then Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم recited
          Verses 1-13 from chapter 13 (Surah Al Ra'ad). Utbah kept listening and
          when Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم reached at the end of verse 13, Utbah
          put his palm upon blessed mouth to stop reciting further and swore to
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم by ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ. He got

        and extended family Banu Muttalib until they handover Prophet صلى الله

        it in Ka'ba. All social ties such as selling, buying food, goods and
        meet-ups were suspended. Abu Talib along with Banu Hashim and Banu
        Muttalib left downtown Makkah to reside in nearby valley sha'ab Abi
        Talib. The boycott was so intense that for days and weeks nothing from
        grain and food could be found and sometimes they were compelled to eat
        wild vegetation, dried cattle skin etc. Children, women and elderly
        members were in severe state of diseases and shortage of nutrition.

          to drink, one of wine and the other of milk. Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم choose the milk, Gabriel said that "You have chosen the Fitrah
          (innate and pure disposition), had you chosen wine your Ummah
          (Believers/Muslims) would have strayed". The symbolism is clear, milk
          is pure and unadulterated, whereas wine is fermented and corrupted.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>c)</strong> From Masjid Al-Aqsa Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          ascended to heavens through a ladder in company of Gabriel. At the
          first heaven Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was welcomed by Prophet Adam
          عليه السلام at second heaven by Prophet Yahya (John) and Prophet Isa
          (Jesus) عليهم السلام who greeted Him as well, at the 4th and 5th
          heaven Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم met Prophet Idris and
          Prophet Harun (Aaron) عليهم السلام respectively. At Sixth heaven
          Prophet Musa (Moses) عليه السلام welcomed Him, at 7th heaven Prophet
          Ibrahim (Abram) عليه السلام greeted Him with words "Welcome, O
          righteous son and righteous Prophet".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>d)</strong> The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then proceeded
          above and beyond the Seventh Heaven at which point He saw Sidrah
          Al-Muntaha (the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary). It begins in the
          Sixth Heaven and transcends into the Seventh Heaven. At this point
          Archangel Gabriel stopped as it is the limit for all creations except
          Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then
          ascended beyond. Whether Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saw ALLAH
          سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ or not has remained a topic of lengthy
          discussion among scholars. Some affirm un-veiled witness and many opt
          the witnessing with a veil of light in between. There are no
          authentically narrated reports about the conversation between Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم and ALLAH Almighty. The meeting was so precious,
          noble and exclusive that its details are not mentioned in Qur'an or
          Hadith. However, ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ in the Qur'an says:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div className="quran-verse">
          "Thus He (ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ) revealed to His Slave
          (Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what He (ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ) revealed."

        However, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was granted with three things:
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>The obligation of five prayers</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>

          </li>

        <p>
          <strong>e) Descend to Jerusalem – journey to Makkah:</strong>
          <br />
          After descending back to Jerusalem, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          returned to Makkah on Buraq. In the morning Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          made call to all Quraysh and narrated the event. Quraysh who had
          visited Jerusalem started asking for landmarks of the Holy City. ALLAH
          سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ brought the city in front of the Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم and He answered all the questions. Quraysh asked about
          anything seen on the way. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم told them about a
          caravan which will reach Makkah in the next three days. Additionally,
          the Prophet said that, the caravan lost a camel which was later on
          found and the same mud color camel will be leading the caravan while
          entering in Makkah having two sacks on the back. That exactly
          happened. One of the chiefs of disbelievers, Waleed bin Moghira,
          called the events and signs an open magic, all disbelievers supported
          his view. One of the Quraysh ran to Abu Bakr and told him that the
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم says such and such about an unbelievable
          journey and asked what opinion Abu Bakar has? Abu Bakr replied most
          diligently: "If He says that, then it is true" the man exclaimed, "Do
          you believe Him?" Abu Bakr replied, "I believe Him in something much
          more amazing than that. He claims that Revelation descends to Him from
          the seven Heavens". Thereafter, he became known as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq
          – The truthful, Al-Siddiq Al-Akbar – the best among truthful.

        of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) and "Madinah Munawwarah" (The Luminous
        City). It was a City north-north east of Makkah, inhabited by two Arab
        tribes namely "Aws" and "Khadhraj" and three Jew settlements naming
        "Banu Qaynqa", "Banu Nudyre" and "Banu Qurayzah". In the 11th year of
        Prophethood 6 people from "Aws" and "Khadhraj" came for Hajj. Prophet
        صلى الله عليه وسلم met them and presented Islam. They embraced the new
        religion and returned to Madinah. Next year during Hajj twelve
        Madinities converted to Islam and pledged to refrain from; theft,
        adultery, vilification, killing offspring and upon following the Prophet
        صلى الله عليه وسلم in all good deeds. Upon their request Mus'ab Bin
        Umair was sent with them as a preacher. This resulted well, as in the
        Hajj of the 13th year of Prophethood, 75 Madinities including two women
        embraced islam. They pledged as well and invited Prophet صلى الله عليه

        After the Hajj, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم directed Makkan Companions to
        migrate. Abu Salma was the first to migrate to Madinah. As the migration
        started, Quraysh disbelievers conspired that if Prophet صلى الله عليه
        وسلم migrated as well, the spread of the new religion will get out of
        control, hence, they decided to assassinate Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.
        Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was waiting for the command from ALLAH
        سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ for Him to migrate. ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ

          <strong>a) Leaving Home:</strong>
          <br />
          Quraysh in a meeting decided to form a unit of chosen young men from
          every Clan of Quraysh who should together fall on Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم, each striking a mortal blow, so His blood will be on every
          clan. The Banu Hashim would not be able to fight the whole tribe;
          rather they would have to accept blood money. ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ revealed their plan to Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم same day early afternoon went to Abu Bakr's house
          and finalized the migration plan. Then, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          returned home and told Ali ibn Abi Talib about Quraysh plot and that
          He will be migrating that night. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم advised
          Ali ibn Abi Talib to stay behind and sleep on His bed under His
          mantle, and the next morning handover the valuables to the owners
          which were deposited with Him for safekeeping by many disbelievers.
          (It is worth noting that, The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was never
          ceased to be known as Al-Amin, The trustworthy). When night fell the
          assassins gathered and seized the Prophet's صلى الله عليه وسلم house
          but, during the gathering around they heard the women voices from the
          blessed house. One of them said that if they climbed over the walls to
          break in, their names would forever be held in dishonor among Arabs
          for violating the privacy of women. Thus, they decided to wait until
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم comes outside. The Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم and Ali ibn Talib were soon became aware of their presence.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم gave Ali His mantle to wrap and sleep on
          His bed, saying that no harm to him will come from assassins. Then,
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم started reciting Surah YA'SIN (Chapter 36)
          of Quran and, when reached to the verse 9:
        </p>

        <div className="quran-verse">
          "and we have placed a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind
          them, and (thus) they are encircled by Us; so they do not see".

          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out of the house; and ALLAH
          سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ took away the enemies' sight so that they
          didn't see Him, and He passed through their midst on His way to Abu
          Bakr's house.

          <br />
          <strong>b) Abu Bakr's House to Cave "Thawr":</strong>
          <br />
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and Abu Bakr, along with Son of Abu Bakr
          (Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr), left immediately from there riding on two
          camels for a cave in the mountain of Thawr, a little south of Makkah
          on the way to Yemen. Abu Bakr returned the camels with Abdullah and
          advised him to listen to what Quraysh would be planning the next
          morning and report at night with news. On the other side the Quraysh
          men saw through the window and found someone sleeping at Prophet's صلى
          الله عليه وسلم bed covered by His mantle. When they saw Ali ibn Abi
          Talib rose from bed, still wrapped in the Prophet's صلى الله عليه وسلم
          mantle, they realized that they had somehow been outwitted. They
          decided to go back and report to their respective chiefs of the clans.
          The Quraysh chiefs immediately called for a search on every possible
          way to Madinah and announced a head money of hundred (100) camels, to
          whosoever catches the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم or kills Him. On the
          third day, the search party reached right on top of the cave entrance.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and Abu Bakr were clearly listening to
          them. Abu Bakr thinking of the Prophet's صلى الله عليه وسلم safety,
          got scared as if disbelievers just look down the cave entrance they
          could see them easily. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said what ALLAH
          revealed as follows:
        </p>

        <div className="quran-verse">
          "Do not grieve. ALLAH is surely with us."
          <div className="verse-reference">(Surah At-Tawbah 9:40)</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          And then said; "O Abu Bakr", what do you think of two (persons), for
          whom ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ is the third?" (Sahih Muslim,
          Hadith 2381)
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>c) Cave Thawr to Madinah:</strong>
          <br />
          After hiding out in the cave for 3 nights and 3 days, Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم and Abu Bakr left for Madinah. Abdullah Ibn Ari'qat an
          expert navigator of the desert, was already hired to take the blessed
          caravan through unknown and unfamiliar routes to Madinah. Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم arrived at Quba, a locality in the outskirt of downtown
          Madinah, and waited for Ali ibn Abi Talib there for around two weeks.
          In Quba Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم laid the stone for the first mosque
          in Islam, the famous Masjid Al-Quba. After 2 weeks Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم left for the main city of Madinah on Friday morning. On the
          way, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم stopped for the Friday prayer at
          settlement of Banu Salamah. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم arrived in
          Madinah in the afternoon. The Madinites including children were
          rushing to greet Him. Even women were witnessing the procession from
          rooftops. Little girls were singing greeting rhymes. Everyone was
          willing to host Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, but Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم replied to all of them that: "Let the camel be, as ALLAH has
          taken care of it (i.e ALLAH will decide)". The camel stopped at a
          particular place in the locality of Bani Najjar, the clan of Prophet's
          صلى الله عليه وسلم great grandmother Salma, wife of Hashim bin Abd
          Manaf and mother of Abd al-Muttalib. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then
          said, "Whose house from our family members is closest? Khalid bin
          Zayd, known famously as Abu Ayub Ansari rose up, proclaimed his
          lineage, ecstatically claimed the right to host Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم. The Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم left for his house.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم stayed there for 6 months until the blessed
          family also migrated and small housing units were built for Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم and His family.

          First thing Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم did upon arriving, was the
          announcement of building the mosque. The land where the camel of
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم first sat was chosen. The land was owned by
          two orphan boys, besides their insistence to donate the land, Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم affectionately refused and directed Abu Bakr to pay
          the agreed price of the land i.e., 400 Dinars (400 gold currency
          coins). During construction of the masjid Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          participated physically by carrying and laying stone blocks. The
          blessed age of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was 53 years at that time.

          immigrants were given the title of "Muhajirun (Immigrants)". Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم announced official brotherhood between each
          individual Muhajir and Ansar. It was declared that their rights upon
          each other would be like real brothers sharing everything and

          Jews living in three settlements around Madinah, namely, Banu Qaynqa,
          Banu Nudyre and Banu Qurayzha, a Charter was formulated and agreed by
          all communities, outlining the rights and duties of both communities
          who were then the citizens of the emerging Islamic State. The treaty
          explained and ensured the freedom of exercising respective religion,

          and steadfast but in Madinah, ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ allowed
          believers to fight back. Following verse of Surah Al-Hajj was revealed
          soon after Hijra:

        <div className="quran-verse">
          "Permission (to fight) is given to those against whom fighting is

          <strong>b)</strong> This fight back is called "JIHAD" (Lit. Meaning,
          'Struggle'). In the present time of print, electronic and digital
          media the word "Jihad" is the most spoken word at every platform in
          connection with Islam and Muslims. However, at the same time, Jihad is
          one of the most misunderstood, misinterpreted and misrepresented part
          of Islam, (although there are others as well, like, Women oppression,
          Hijab and Criminal Penal Code etc.). Here I would like to present a
          brief but concise elaboration on 'Jihad' in following sub-paragraphs:
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>
            i) DEFINITION OF JIHAD FROM OXFORD DICTIONARY OF WORLD RELIGIONS:
          </strong>
          <br />
          It is important here to clearly understand the meaning of "Jihad",
          which in present times is commonly misunderstood in connection with
          non-state militant groups' activities which are purely unlawful and
          contrary to Shariah Law. Definition of Jihad as per Oxford Dictionary
          of World Religions reproduced below also gives the similar
          understanding and meaning:
        </p>

        <div className="quote-box">
          "(Arab, jahada, meaning "he made effort"), more fully, jihad fi sabi
          lillah, "Striving in the cause of God". Jihad is usually translated as
          'holy war' but this is misleading. Jihad is divided into two
          categories, the greater and the lesser (Jihad); the greater jihad is
          the warfare in self against any evil or temptation. The lesser Jihad
          is the defence of Islam, or a Muslim country or community, against
          aggression. It may be a Jihad of the pen or of the tongue. If it
          involves conflict it is strictly regulated and can only be declared
          and led by the government of a Muslim majority country."
        </div>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>ii) Categories of Jihad:</strong>
          <br />
          Dr Yasir Qadhi, gives a precise categorisation of "Jihad", in
          connection with Prophetic Mission of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه
          وسلم, for both the before and after Hijra eras.

          <strong>a) Show of Presence</strong>
          <br />
          After establishment of a fully functioning first ever "Muslim State of
          Madinah", Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم turned towards the archenemy of
          Islam, "The Quraysh of Makkah", who had not only put all possible
          hurdles to eliminate The Religion of Islam, but also compelled Muslims
          to migrate, in order to protect and keep their faith in Islam alive.
          Then, the time had come to respond to Quraysh,the most arrogant and
          heinous people towards the religion of Islam. Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم started with small expeditions against Quraysh trade caravans.
          The objectives were;
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>* to demonstrate the political and military presence of Islam,</p>
        <p>
          * to strangle the Quraysh trade to Syria and Egypt which was the
          lifeline of Quraysh, who oppressed Muslims and Islam to wipe out the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          * to strengthen the Muslims to carry on the religion with a strong
          mental and financial base.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>b) Military expeditions</strong>
          <br />
          Military expeditions in the Prophetic time were of two types.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          * Battle in which Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم participated personally
          are called Ghazwah (plural Ghazwat).
        </p>
        <p>
          * battle which were ordereded by Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, but He
          was not part of troops, are called Sariyyah (plural Saraya)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>
            c) Saraya during 1st Year Hijra <br />
          </strong>
          In months Ramadan, Shawwal and Dhual-Qa'ad Prophet sent three small
          military campaigns under command of Hamza, Ubaidah bin Harith and
          Sa'ad bin abi Waqas to raid Quraysh trade caravans. None of the
          expedition turned into an encounter, except exchange of some shooting
          of arrows took place. All campaigns consisted of Mohajir soldiers
          only, no Ansar was deployed.

        <p>
          <strong>a)</strong> First time Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم led small
          military campaigns towards three different places, namely, Abwa, Bawat
          and Ushayrah early in the year. On each occasion the Quraysh caravan
          had passed before the arrival of Muslim troops, hence, no war broke
          out. However, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم made treaties for peace and
          cooperation with surrounding tribes of Banu Damrah and Banu Mad'laj.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>b)</strong> Around Jamadi al-Thani (6th Month of 2nd Hijra), a
          Quraysh man Karz bin Jabir Fah'ri ambushed grass farms of Madina,
          killed three herdsmen, looted camels and cattle and ran away. Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم followed until village of Safwan near town of Badr,
          but he had fled. This is called Ghazwah Badr first, Badr Sughra
          (small), and Ghazwah Saf'wan as well.

    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>a)</strong> The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم received
          information about a Makkah bound caravan of Quraysh from Syria known
          to be the biggest caravan Quraysh traders ever invested in.
          Intercepting the caravan would therefore be significant as it would
          bring their economy to a screeching halt, while simultaneously
          empowering the Muslims and specially Mohajir's whose wealth and houses
          in Makkah had been unjustly confiscated by the Quraysh. Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم made an announcement in Mosque. He said, "We have a
          mission to undertake, so whoever has his camel ready shall come with
          Me". Details were kept secret. The people who could get ready
          immediately, assembled on that very short notice. A total of 313
          soldiers including 82 Mohajirs and 231 Ansars got ready, the convoy
          was not prepared for war, as the aim was to raid the caravan in
          surprise. The whole group had two horses, 100 camels and minimal
          armour and weaponry.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>b)</strong> On the other side Abu Suffiyan, the chief of
          caravan had also sent out counterspies to observe the Prophet's صلى
          الله عليه وسلم spies. Abu Sufyan's spy reported seeing two men at a
          distance, Abu Sufyan reached the scene, although men were not found
          but the camel dung was evident. Abu Sufyan, an astute and seasoned
          chief, cracked a few pieces of dung and found undigested date seeds.
          He concluded that they were spies from madinites and muslims were
          close to ambush the caravan. He altered the route and sent a man to
          Makkah asking for troops to immediately reinforce the security of the
          caravan. Quraysh in a single day mobilized 1300 men, at least one each
          from the household of Makkah, so far, the biggest battalion of Quraysh
          history. They had 100 horses, 600 armor suits, hundreds of camels and
          more than sufficient support supplies. To show the power singing girls
          and barrels of wine were part of supplies. Meanwhile, Abu Sufyan,
          escaping the threat, sent a message that they were safe and additional
          support was no longer a need. Many of Quraysh chiefs opined to
          discontinue the mission, but Abu Jahl was adamant, "no, we will go to
          Badr and stay there for three days. We will drink our wine, have women
          singing for us, and let the Arabs hear that we are a strong and mighty
          nation." At this point some smaller allied clans left and Quraysh
          troops reduced to 950-1000, who left for Badr.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>c)</strong> Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم also had information
          that caravan had fled but Quraysh were heading towards plains of Badr.
          The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم began to quiz the companions, asking
          what they thought if Quraysh were ready to fight. As the Muslims left
          Madinah for an easy raid on caravan, they neither were prepared nor
          expected a full hostile war, hence, some of them showed reservations.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then said, "Makkah has presented to you the
          cream of the crop". He added, "By ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ! So
          and so over here (pointing) and so and so will be killed over there,"
          He named them one by one, pointing to different locations. The Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم then asked the companions thrice "what do you think
          we should do?" Abu bakr first, then Umar Ibn Khattab and Miqdad ibn
          A'mr (all three mohajirs) stood up one after the other and showing
          unconditional support to whatever the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم had
          decided. Miqdad said "O messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم of ALLAH, do as
          ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ has commanded you, and we are right
          behind you; O Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم of ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ we will not say to you as the Children of Israel said to
          Musa (Moses) عليه السلام 'So go both you and your Lord and fight', we
          are staying right here', rather we say, 'Go both you and your Lord and
          fight, we are right behind you'; O messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم of
          ALLAH Almighty take us to all corners of the world, and we will follow
          you until we meet ALLAH Almighty's decree!" The Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم thanked him and asked for the fourth time, "what do you think we
          should do?" silence ensued, then the great leader of Ansars, Sa'ad ibn
          Mu'adh stood up, saying, "perhaps you are intending us (Ansars), O
          Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم of ALLAH"? (At the covenant of Aqabah,
          the Ansars pledged to protect the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم from all
          aggression, but the upcoming battle of Badr did not constitute the
          defensive jihad, so it was technically outside the fold of the pledge.
          The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم did not want to force Ansars to
          continue, as they did not pledged to partake in this type of combat).
          The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied in the affirmative, then Sa'ad
          said, "O Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم of ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ
          we believe in You and trusted You; we testified that You have come
          with the truth", we gave You our promises and oaths that we will
          listen and obey, so go forth and do as You see fit for, we are with
          You. I swear by the One Who has sent You with the truth, were you to
          take us to oceans and charge, galloping into the sea, we would go
          right behind You. We are not scared to meet the enemy tomorrow, and we
          will show You our patience in battle. Perhaps ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ will show You, through us, that will comfort You".
          Prophet's صلى الله عليه وسلم blessed face which was described as a
          shining moon became further radiant, overjoyed with Sa'ad's response.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>d)</strong> Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم arrived at Badr on 16th
          Ramadan 2 Hijra and set up the camp, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          spent whole night making profused supplications and prolonging his
          prostrations. Early morning Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم lined up the
          companions. There after Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم once again turned
          to his Lord, raising His blessed hands, saying, "O ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ, fulfil your promise to me, O Allah سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ, give me what You have promised; O ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ
          وَتَعَالَىٰ if this group is destroyed, you will not be worshiped on
          Earth." As soon as Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم lowered his blessed
          hands, ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ sent down the revelation:
        </p>
        <br />

        <div className="quran-verse">
          "I am going to support you with a thousand angels, one following the
          others."
          <div className="verse-reference">

        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          The invitation duel was a custom in those days to commence a war.
          Quraysh sent out Utbah bin Rabiah and Shaybah bin Rabiah (two
          brothers) alongside Walid bin Utbah. From Muslim troops three Ansars
          Auf Ibn Afra, Mu'aw'widh ibn Afra and Abdullah ibn Rawaha rose up.
          Quraysh called out that they have no issue with Ansars then added, "O
          Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم send out equals worthy of us to fight".
          The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "stand up, O Ubaydah ibn
          al-Harith, and you O Hamza; and you O Ali" (it is worth mentioning
          that Hamza was Prophet's صلى الله عليه وسلم uncle, Ubaydah and Ali
          were Cousins, so Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم responded not from
          Mohajirs in general, but from the blessed Prophetic Family (The Ahl
          al-Bayt), the closest blood of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم). Ubaydah
          took Utbah, Hamza took Shaybah and Ali walked towards al-Waleed. Hamza
          and Ali instantaneously killed their opponents. Meanwhile Ubaydah got
          his leg cut, Ali and Hamza both turned to support him and killed
          Utbah. After this event the open war started. Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم fought as well, alternated between commanding, making
          supplications and fighting physically. ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ
          sent down 1000 Angels. In reality ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ did
          not need to send 1000 when one single Angel would have sufficed
          considering their supernatural existence, it was a show of force to
          assure muslims of the divine support. Many muslims troops, later on,
          reported their observations as opponents getting killed or wounded
          while they had only raised their swords. Similarly, many Quraysh men
          who embraced Islam in following years reported seeing unknown and
          apparently different people among files of Muslim army. Abbas Ibn
          Abdul Muttalib, uncle of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم who was Captive
          after the war, reported that the muslim apparently made him captive
          was not the one who caught him in the battle field, and That was a
          well cleanly dressed beautiful men who caught him. Banu Hashim the
          Prophetic Family who hadn't yet embraced Islam and living in Makkah
          were forced to join Badr troops by Abu Jahl and other Polytheist
          Chiefs of Quraysh. When victory for Muslims became clear, the Quraysh
          fled back. 70 of them were killed and 70 were captured. Muslims
          suffered 14 Martyrdoms and of course no captives. Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم ensured proper burial of martyrs. The dead of Quraysh were
          also placed in an abandoned well and covered them with sand.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>e)</strong> Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم had the sunnah of
          staying three days at the battle field after victory. During this stay
          ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ revealed commands about distribution of
          spoils of war (Maal al-Ghanimah) According to which one-fifth (1/5) is
          for ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ and His Messenger صلى الله عليه
          وسلم, and to be spent upon, Prophet's صلى الله عليه وسلم close
          relatives, orphans, poors and (needy) travelers; rest of four (4/5) to
          be distributed among the troops. Regarding prisoners of war, messages
          were sent to their families in Quraysh for paying ransom; the amount
          of ransom was according to the financial status of their respective
          families. Those among captives knew reading and writing were advised
          to teach 10 Madinite children as their ransom. Some captives who were
          neither literate nor wealthy were freed without ransom.

        Madinah, who were part of the charter, Mithaq Al-Madinah, as mentioned
        earlier). Upon knowing the incident Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم tried to
        amicably settle down the issue with negotiation and justice for women
        but Banu Qaynuqa Chiefs in response went arrogant and replied that,
        "Muslims shouldn't remain deceived from their triumph in Badr, we are
        not Quraysh, we are Jew the people of sword", and announced leaving
        charter unilaterally (they were 2000 in total with 700 men able to

        two weeks they surrendered unconditionally, agreeing and leaving the
        decision from their nominated chosen pre-Islam allies from Ansars as

        Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم listened to
        him patiently and it was decided that Banu Qaynuqa should be exiled from
        Madinah leaving all arms behind. So, they left for Khayber and other Jew
        settlements in Arabia, distant from Madinah.

        <strong>a)</strong> For Quraysh disbelievers, the motives of this
        battles were three fold:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>The religious animosity</li>
          <li>Desperation for face saving after the defeat at Badr</li>
          <li>
            Blocking of their trade route to Syria, resulting in economic
            suffering
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Until then the war was between Muslim and Quraysh, but after Quraysh
          allying tribes of Kinanah and Tihama, the paradigm shifted to Islam vs
          Kufr; lines were drawn and sides were chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>b)</strong> On 7th Shawwal (10th month of 3rd Hijra) Quraysh
          left Makkah with 3000 fighting men, 700 were armored and 200 were on
          horseback. Two dozen women from noble families were also part of the
          army to boost their morale during the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>c)</strong> Owing to Abbas ibn Abd al-Mutalib's secret
          forewarning, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم had two days to act.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم convened a general meeting and asked for
          input from all companions to deal the situation. Many elder Madinite
          companions, including Abdullah ibn Ubai (the Chief of Hypocrites)
          recommended to defend Madinah staying inside the city. Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم was himself in the favor of this recommendation, but
          young companions, especially those who couldn't take part in battle of
          Badr, insisted to confront Quraysh outside the city, and as they were
          majority, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم honored their proposal. An army
          of 1000 men left Madinah for northern plain besides Uhud Mountain,
          which is in fact a collection of peaks spanning one whole mile. While
          in the midway Abdullah ibn Ubai alongwith his 300 men (the hypocrites)
          left the marching troops, saying that "Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          listened to youth and left my advice, why should we risk our lives
          fighting for Him, when He didn't listen to us".
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>d)</strong> However, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم arranged the
          muslim formations strategically and deployed 50 archers upon a mound
          on the rear of His troops to safeguard from an enemy breach from the
          back. The War broke out and some 650 Muslim sword men tore apart the
          enemy so furiously that 3000 disbelievers suffered severe casualties.
          They started running and scattering, leaving behind their arms and
          belongings. At this point the archers placed at the mound started
          discussing leaving their post and joining the others in collecting the
          spoils of war. Their commander Abdullah Ibn Jubair tried to convince
          them to stay at their post but 40 of them left the place. Khalid bin
          Waleed (who later become the most successful commander of Muslims and
          history of war, Titled as "Sword of Allah" by the Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم) who was disbeliever till than observed the gap created and
          invaded with 200 men. The 10 archers left at the mound were
          outnumbered and martyred in no time. Khalid's men attacked from rear,
          muslim troops unaware of the changing scenario got frustrated,
          received heavy casualties and scattered in desperation everywhere.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم himself received a deep wound on the
          blessed face and shoulder, but maintained ground with a few companions
          around protecting Him from every side. After a little recovery
          companions took Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم away, up the mountain at a
          safe place. Meanwhile news erupted among enemy that Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم has been martyred. Quraysh who had already packed up to
          return heard this, Abu Sufyan the commander shouted name of Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم if He was alive or martyred, and names of Abu Bakr
          and Omer also. Omer replied that they all are alive. Abu sufyan
          shouted, this is war which swings both ways, today was the revenge of
          Badr. Then Abu Sufyan left for Makkah.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>e)</strong> Muslims had 70 men martyred and dozens wounded
          badly. It was the saddest day in Madinah so far. Hamza bin Abd
          al-Muttalib, the uncle of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and Mus'ab bin
          Omair who were two of the early Makkan Muslims were also among the
          martyrs. Quraish women mutilated the bodies of martyrs, Abu Sufyan's
          wife Hind, mutilated Hamza in revenge of her brothers, son and uncle
          killed in Badr.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>f)</strong> Next morning Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم thought
          about a possible return of the enemy, hence, ordered an immediate
          expedition with only those who fought yesterday. Wounded companions
          obeyed the command and troops marched up to a place called Ham'ra
          al-Asad eight miles out of Madinah. Meanwhile, Quraysh on the way back
          were thinking about the unfinished job and while discussing to return
          for a conclusive assault; heard that Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is
          behind them waiting for any such move, Quraysh decided to continue to
          Makkah. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم returned to Madinah ensuring that
          the threat was over. The Battle of Uhud drew a clean line between pure
          muslims and hypocrites, like Badr, which drew a line between believers
          and nonbelievers.

        A Najdi tribal chief Amir bin Malik came to Madinah. Prophet صلى الله
        عليه وسلم invited him to Islam. Amir bin malik neither accepted nor
        denied and requested for sending a few preachers with him to his tribe,
        so as to get the whole tribe converted. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم sent
        70 companions well versed with Quran and Sunnah. Amir, while approaching
        his territory, secretly called tribes of Ra'al and Zakwan, and killed
        all the preachers. Only Amr' bin Umayyah survived and reported back.
        Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم sent an expedition which effectively crushed
        the deceivers and killers of martyred companions. Similarly, around the
        same time, tribes of A'dal and Qarah arrived and asked Prophet صلى الله
        عليه وسلم to send back with them a group of companions to teach them
        about the religion. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم sent 6 (or 10 in some
        other tradition) companions with them. When they reached a spot called
        "Ar-Raji" between Rabigh and Jeddah, 100 archers from Banu Lih'yan tribe
        surrounded them, martyred 4 of them and arrested Khubaib and Zaid bin
        Ad-Dathani. Both were handed over to Quraysh for head money, and later
        martyred by Quraysh.

          <strong>a)</strong> Banu al-Nadir were part of treaty "Mithaq Madinah"
          and remained peaceful, until they witness the damaging end of battle
          of Uhud, and incidents of Be'ar Ma'ounah and Ar-Raji', they started
          conspiring and hatching plots with Quraysh against muslims. Meanwhile,
          a case of blood money upon companion Amr' Bin Umayyah Damri was filed
          who had unknowingly killed two men of Bani Kilab, thinking them the
          people from the enemy who killed companions at Be'ar Mau'nah. Bani
          Kilab were allied tribe of state of Madinah; when Amr bin Umayyah
          reported what he had done, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to him,
          "you have killed two people, their blood money shall be a debt I have
          to discharge". Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked Banu Nadir to pay
          their share in accordance with the clauses of Treaty of Madinah
          (Mithaq Madinah) that both parties had signed. Banu Nadir agreed to
          pay, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم reached at their place. Awaiting
          meeting, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم alongwith Abu Bakr, Umer, Ali and
          few other companions sit under the wall of Banu Nadir fortress. Jews
          conspired to drop a large stone from up the wall on the blessed head
          of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. The most wicked of them Amir Bin Ja'hsh
          volunteered to carry out the task. One of them Salam bin Mushkam,
          cautioned them, predicting that ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ would
          reveal their plot to Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and such an act would
          constitute a flagrant violation of the Treaty they had with Muslims.
          Meanwhile, ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ revealed their plan to
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and He left the place immediately, on the
          way back Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم told companions of the Divine
          Revelation about criminal intention of Jews.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>b)</strong> Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم gave ultimatum to Bani
          Nadir to either evacuate Madinah within 10 days or they will be
          killed. Chief of hypocrites Abdullah Ibn Ubayy told Jews not to pay
          attention and he will support them with 2000 men, he also assured the
          help from other Jew locality of Banu Qurayzah and an anti-Islam desert
          tribe Banu Ghatfan. So Jews didn't take account of the ultimatum and
          replied that, they will not leave, do whatever you like".
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>c)</strong> After the above reply from Bani Nadir, Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم invaded Jew locality and sieged it. Jews were
          comfortably safe in their fortress surrounded by thick palm trees,
          archering from hideouts. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered to cut and
          burn their palm orchards. Although cutting and burning trees in war
          was not allowed, but on this occasion ALLAH سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ
          permitted it by revealing:
        </p>

        <div className="quran-verse">
          "Whatever palm-trees you have cut down, or have left them standing on
          their roots, it was with Allah's permission, and so that He might
          disgrace the transgressors."
          <div className="verse-reference">(Surah al-Hashr 59:5)</div>

          <br />
          <strong>d)</strong> The siege did not last long for ALLAH the
          Al-mighty, cast horror into their hearts and they willingly offered to
          leave the Madinah. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم accepted it and
          allowed them to carry as much luggage as their camels can carry,
          except the weapon. They left for Khyber with 600 loaded camels.

          <br />
          <strong>a)</strong> The Jews of Khyber under Huyey bin Akhtab, the
          leader of the exiled tribe Banu Nadir, and Quraysh under Abu Sufyan
          made an alliance to launch a fatal assault against the Muslim State of
          Madinah. Huyey further strengthened it by forming a Confederation with
          Eastern Arab Najdi Bedouin tribes i.e. Banu Ghatfan, Bani Asad, Banu
          Murra, and Banu Sulaym etc. by offering half share in all khyber
          Dates-Palm products. In total, the strength of the Confederate army,
          though not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated to have included
          around 10,000 men and six hundred horsemen.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>b)</strong> Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, upon
          receiving information gathered the Madinites to discuss the strategy.
          The outnumbered Muslims opted to engage in a defensive battle. Madinah
          was surrounded by difficult to cross lava rocks on eastern and western
          sides and thick Palm gardens in the south. North was open and
          vulnerable. Companion Salman Farsi (The Persian) presented the Persian
          way of Digging a Ditch/Trench to defend the northern side. The
          proposal was adopted unanimously.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>c)</strong> Every capable Muslim in Madinah including Prophet
          Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم contributed to digging the massive trench
          in six days. Women and children were moved to the inner city in small
          fortresses. All the crops were harvested early, so the Confederate
          armies would have to rely on their own food reserves.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>d)</strong> The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم established his
          military headquarters at the hillock of Sala' and the 3,000 men army
          was arrayed there. Banu Qurayzah, the only Jew settlement in Madinah,
          had promised to remain neutral.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>e)</strong> The siege of Madinah began in Shawwal the tenth
          month of 5th hijrah and lasted for 20 nights and 6 days of digging the
          Trench. Since sieges were uncommon in Arabian warfare, the arriving
          Confederates were unprepared to deal with the trenches. The
          Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of f30orcing a
          passage, but the Madinites were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a
          crossing. Both the armies on either side of the Ditch continued
          exchanging arrows for almost three weeks. On the other hand, the
          harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had trouble finding food
          for their horses.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>f)</strong> The Confederate army made several other attempts
          to cross the trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although
          the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole
          length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at the
          close-quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in
          hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug-in behind the
          embankment made from the earth which had been taken from the ditch and
          prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could
          cause great casualties.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>g)</strong> From the Confederates, Huyay ibn Akhtab,
          approached Jews of Banu Qurayzah seeking their support against the
          Muslims from inside Madinah. So far, the Banu Qurayzah who were
          neutral and were hesitant about joining the Confederates since they
          had earlier made a pact with Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. When Huyay
          approached them, their leader refused to allow him entry, but
          eventually, the sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the
          land swung the Qurayzah's opinion in the favor of the Confederacy. The
          Qurayzah also possessed weapons: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits
          of armour, and 500 shields.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>h)</strong> News of the Qurayzah's renunciation of the pact
          with Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم leaked out. The Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم realised the grave potential danger the Qurayzah posed.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم deployed 100 men and 300 horsemen to the
          inner city for its protection (cavalry was not needed at the trench).
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>j)</strong> Besides the inside threat, the Muslims found
          themselves in greater difficulties by each passing day. Food was
          running short, and nights were colder, the lack of sleep made matters
          worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, four from
          five canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Prophet صلى الله
          عليه وسلم and Muslim troops. Only at night, when the attacks stopped
          due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. everywhere.
          Considering the worsening conditions Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم sent
          word to Ghatfan, trying to pay for their defection and offering them a
          third of Madinah's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatfan
          demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiate on those terms.
          Before Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم began the order of drafting the
          agreement, He consulted the Ansar leaders Sa'ad ibn Mo'adh and Sa'ad
          bin Ubadah. Both chiefs enquired that if it is a Prophetic command, so
          that they submit obediently or a strategic worldly move? Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم replied that it is His consideration to reduce the
          hardship of Muslims by cutting away a chunk from confederates. Upon
          listening to the reply both chiefs opposed the effort by saying that
          Madinah had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations
          were broken off.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>k)</strong> While the Ghatfan did not retreat they had
          compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Madinah, and
          the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased. At
          about that point, Nuaym ibn Masud, an Arab leader who was
          well-respected by the entire confederacy, secretly converted to Islam.
          Nuaym offered his service to end the siege by creating discord amongst
          the Confederates. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم allowed him to play his
          tactics. Nuaym first went to the Banu Qurayzah and warned them about
          the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy. He said that if the
          siege failed, the Confederacy would not be afraid to abandon the Jews,
          leaving them at the mercy of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. The
          Qurayzah should therefore demand Confederate leaders as hostages in
          return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the
          Qurayzah had already harbored. Next, Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, and
          other Confederate leaders, warning them that the Qurayzah had defected
          to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. He stated that the tribe intended to
          ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for
          cooperation, but really to hand over to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم.
          Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man a hostage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>l)</strong> Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the
          Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl to the Qurayzah,
          signaling a united invasion of Madinah. The Qurayzah, however,
          demanded hostages as a guarantee that the Confederacy would not desert
          them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayzah might give the
          hostage to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, refused. Messages were
          repeatedly sent back and forth between the parties, but each held to
          its position stubbornly. Abu Sufyan summoned Huyay ibn Akhtab,
          informing him of Qurayzah's response. Huyay was taken aback, and Abu
          Sufyan branded him as a "traitor". Fearing for his life, Huyay fled to
          the Qurayzah's strongholds. The Bedouins, the Ghatfan, and other
          Confederates from Najd had already been compromised by Prophet's صلى
          الله عليه وسلم negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in
          hopes of plunder, rather than for personal reasons. They lost hope as
          chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The
          two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual
          distrust.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>m)</strong> For days the weather had been exceptionally cold
          and wet. The provisions of the Confederate armies were running out.
          Horses and camels were dying of hunger and wounds. Above all these
          oddities, one cold night, miraculously, Violent freezing winds blew
          out the campfires, taking away from the Confederate army their source
          of heat. The enemy's tents were torn up, their fires were
          extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces and they were
          terrified by the portents against them. They had already well nigh
          fallen out among themselves. During the night the Confederate armies
          withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong>n)</strong> The last assault by disbelievers upon muslim state
          was over, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم declared that it was the last
          occasion and than onward only muslims will assault against Quraysh and
          disbelievers, and surely they will not return.

          a). Immediately after the miraculous successful defense of Madinah and
          retreat of confederate army of Pagans, under divine command, Prophet
          صلى الله عليه وسلم and 3000 Muslim soldiers sieged the Jews settlement
          of Bani Qurayzah to punish them for their wicked plan of bringing
          confederate armies of almost all pagan Arabs upon muslims. Siege
          continued for one month. Banu Qurayzah chief Ka'b bin Asad offered his
          people three options:
          <br />* embrace Islam and save everything,
          <br />* kill your women and children yourself, and fight till either
          all Muslims are killed or every Jew is killed by Muslims.

          no worldly work day and Muslim would not be thinking of an attack.
          <br />
          <br />
          b). Jews refused all three recommendations of their chief and
          approached their former allies in Ansars, the al-Aous tribe. The tribe
          interceded on their behalf begging the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم to
          be lenient towards them. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم suggested that
          Sa'ad bin Mu'adh, the chief of al-Aous may be deputized to give a
          verdict, Jews agreed upon Sa'ad bin Mu'adh appointment. Sa'ad bin
          Mu'adh sat for judgment and asked if his judgment would be accepted by
          all those present including Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم Himself.
          Everybody replied positively. Sa'ad bin Mu'adh then according to the
          Torah judged, that "all the able-bodied men belonging to bani Qurayzah
          should be put to death, the women and children be taken as prisoners
          and their wealth be divided among muslim soldiers". The Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم accepted his judgment saying that Sa'ad had judged
          according to command of ALLAH سبحانه وتعالى . The judgment was
          implemented accordingly.

        <p>
          a). In Dhu al-Qa'ad (11th month) of 6th hijra Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم had a dream in which He saw that He had entered the Haram (sacred
          sanctuary) of Makkah in security of his followers and was performing
          ceremonies of Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). As soon as He informed some
          of his companions about the dream, they became extremely happy.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم along with 1400 companions left for Makkah
          in Ehram. Ehram includes the Niyyah (intention) to perform Hajj or
          Umrah, immediately after intentions some bindings are levied upon
          pilgrims and a dress code for men only i.e two cloth mantles, one
          around waist and the other upon shoulders. Women need to do Niyyah
          (intention) only and dress in regular clothes.
          <br />
          <br />
          b). The caravan of pilgrims had no weapons except their sheathed
          swords of travelers. Approaching close to Makkah, reports were
          received that Quraysh had blocked the regular road. Muslims opted to
          detour and stopped before the sacred boundary of Makkah called "Hudud
          Haram" (a peripheral area around City of Makkah marked by Prophet
          Ibrahim السالم علیہ upon Divine Command when He built the Ka'ba). The
          place was called Hudaybiyah having a Well with little water.
          <br />
          <br />
          c). Negotiation between Quraysh and Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم started
          by the initiative of Budayl bin Warqa of Al-Khuza'ah tribe followed by
          Al-Hulais bin Alqamah of Aha'beesh tribe and Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafi
          a chief from Ta'if city. But all these efforts brought just a halt
          only. 70-80 hot-tempered young Qurayshi men secretly decided to ambush
          the pilgrims camp to break the war, but were captured by the guards.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم released them free, keeping in view of the
          far-reaching imminent results about to be achieved.
          <br />
          <br />
          d). As no results of negotiation were achieved, Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم decided to send Uthman bin Affan as envoy, to tell Quraysh that,
          <br />* Muslims had come for pilgrimage and worship only for few days
          with no intentions of any conflict or fight,
          <br />* also to call them to Islam, and
          <br />* also give glad tiding to the believers in Makkah about
          prevalence and an expected future victory of muslims over Pagans.
          Uthman met Abu Sufyan and other chiefs and assured them that after
          performing Umrah muslims will return peacefully, but the Quraysh
          remained inflexible. They, however, offered Uthman to perform Umrah.
          Uthman declined the offer saying, "how is it possible that I avail
          myself of this opportunity, while the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is
          denied of it".
          <br />
          <br />
          e). Muslims anxiously waited for Uthman's return, but when his return
          was delayed suspicions about foul play by Quraysh started arising.
          Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم stood under a tree and asked muslims for
          pledge (Bai'at) that they would not flee. 1400 plus people pledged for
          death. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم even hold out his own hand and said
          "this is for Uthman". After the pledge was complete, Uthman arrived
          and gave the pledge himself. This pledge is called "Bai'at ar-Ridwan"
          and is a distinguished one among pledges, which is mentioned by ALLAH
          سبحانه وتعالى : "Allah was pleased with the believers when they were
          pledging allegiance with You (by placing their hands in Your hands)
          under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down
          tranquility upon them,and rewarded them with a victory, near at hand",
          (Surah al-Fateh, Ch: 48, Verse:18)
          <br />
          <br />
          f). Finally Suhail bin Amr' a chief of Quraysh, came to negotiate.
          Both parties agreed to conclude a Treaty of reconciliation as follows:
          <br />* The Muslims shall return this time and come back next year;
          <br />* They shall not stay in Makkah for more than three days;
          <br />* They shall not come back armed, but can bring with them only
          sheathed swords in scabbards and these shall be kept in bags;
          <br />* War activities shall be suspended for ten years, during which
          both parties will live in full security and neither will raise sword
          against the other;
          <br />* Whoever wishes to join Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم or enter
          into treaty with Him, should have the liberty to do so, likewise;
          <br />* whosoever, wishes to join the Quraysh, or enter into treaty
          with them, should be allowed to do so; and
          <br />* If anyone from Makkah goes over to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم
          without his guardian's permission, referring to a fugitive, should be
          returned to Quraysh, however, if any of Muhammad's صلى الله عليه وسلم
          followers return to Makkah, he should not be sent back.
          <br />
          <br />
          g). Muslims returned from Hudaybiyah, generally heart broken, but with
          believe that ALLAH یٰ تعال- و سبحانہ and his Messenger صلى الله عليه
          وسلم know the best. However, following the Treaty of Hudaibiyah its
          benefits were realized in the coming years, they are;
          <br />* First time ever Quraysh recognized the legitimacy of State of
          Madinah on equal terms;
          <br />* Quraysh, indirectly, gave up their religious leadership of
          Arabia;
          <br />* Muslim had the opportunity to reach out to spread Islam to
          those areas which were not explored.
          <br />* Muslims of Madinah started visiting Makkah, a free interaction
          opened among people including surrounding tribes. Thus, Within two
          years twice as many people entered in Islam than ever before.
          <br />* Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم who went for Umrah with 1400 people
          entered Makkah victoriously with 10,000 soldiers just after two years
          of treaty.

      <p>
        In the same 6th Hijra after treaty of Hudaybiyah, Prophet صلى الله عليه
        وسلم sent letters to Emperors of Byzantine empire, Iranian empire (the
        two superpowers of the time) and other Kingdoms like Avicenna, Egypt,
        Oman, Yemen, Bahrain etc, inviting them to Islam. All recipients of the
        blessed letter replied with honor and respect, though did not accept the
        invitation to Islam. However, the Iranian emperor shredded the blessed
        Prophetic letter and very arrogantly replied to the Muslim envoy.

    title: "36. CONQUEST OF KHYBER",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          a). Khayber, the stronghold of Jews with 8 big and few smaller forts
          and nearby Jew towns of Taima and Fadak were the center of conspiracy
          against Islam and Muslims.
          <br />
          <br />
          b). It is worth mentioning that Quraysh hostility was based upon
          rejection of their just few centuries old baseless Paganism. Quraysh
          were aware that they were Ishmaelites, knowing that Ishmael السالم
          علیہ was son of Ibrahim السالم علیہ and both were the monotheists,
          they always called Ka'ba the "Bait ALLAH" (the house of ALLAH سبحانه
          وتعالى ). Upon intra-Quraysh differences, they consider such
          differences as just a difference of opinion between clans of a tribe
          from the same ancestors.
          <br />
          <br />
          c). On the other hand, Jews opposition was far deep and old, even more
          than a millennia. Their claim was based on few false
          misinterpretations of Old Testament, i.e,
          <br />* Jews are ethnically chosen one by the ALLAH یٰ تعال و سبحانہ
          <br />* Prophethood and Messenger ship belongs to ethnic Jews only;
          <br />* The Messiah and the final Prophet will come and build the
          third temple at Jerusalem, then the jew will rule the world. (First
          temple was destroyed by Babylonians about 586 BCE, and the second
          temple was destroyed by Roman Pagans in 70 CE).
          <br />* In the light of prophecies from Old Testament they knew that
          the final Messenger will born in Arabia, even knowing the name and the
          additional signs, but where they went wrong, was their believe that
          the final Messenger will be from the lineage of Yahuda (Judah) son of
          Yaqoob (Jacob) السالم علیہ. So, when ALLAH سبحانه وتعالى raised
          Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم from same place Jews knew, having
          the same name they knew from scriptures, but from lineage of Ishmael,
          this only difference broke the fire of hatred and jealousy in their
          blind hearts and they become the worst enemy of Prophet Muhammad صلى
          الله عليه وسلم and his Message i.e. Islam.
          <br />
          <br />
          d). There were three distinct enemies of Islam in the Arabian
          Peninsula- the Quraysh, the Jews and Najdi Tribes (Najd is upper
          eastern quarter of present Saudi Arabia, capital city Riyadh and
          around). The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم after neutralization of
          Quraysh, considered it appropriate to resolve the affairs concerning
          other two, so that peace and security can prevail and muslims can
          devote their time and efforts in propagating Islam.
          <br />
          <br />
          e). As Khyber was the center of instigation so Prophet صلى الله عليه
          وسلم gave it priority. After two months of Treaty of Hudaybiyah in
          late Muharram (1st month of 7th Hijra), Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          invited those who were willing to fight in the cause of ALLAH سبحانه
          وتعالى to accompany Him in the march against Khyber. 1400 men swore
          allegiance and responded to the call. Chief of hypocrites Abdullah bin
          Ubai informed the Jews and they immediately sent an envoy to Bani
          Ghatfan for military support. But Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم chose a
          way to Khyber which was cutting the Ghatfan-Khyber route, thus
          disabling any support for Jews from Ghatfan.
          <br />
          <br />
          f). Khyber had 08 (eight) strong fortresses namely, Na'um, As-Sa'ad
          bin Mu'alh, Az-Zuhair, Ubai, An-Nizar, in one sector of Khyber and
          Al-Qamus, Al-Watih and As-Sulalin in the other sector. The Prophet صلى
          الله عليه وسلم established Headquarters at a strategic location and
          started besieging forts one after the other. The first to fall was the
          fortress of Na'um. Marhab the known swordsman and wrestler of Na'um
          came out with heavy armor and asked for a duel. Ali ibn Abi Talib
          faced him and with a single stroke, cut his helmet and his head. The
          war broke out and Na'um was captured, Jews ran to the next fortress.
          This happened to all five fortresses of the first sector. Jews fled
          and strengthened themselves in the next sector of their fortresses.
          <br />
          <br />
          g). Fortress of Qamus: Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was having migraine
          pain, hence, first Abu Bakr was given the flag to assault, muslims
          under his command tried but couldn't conquer the fort. Next day Umer
          ibn Khattab was given command, this day also went without the conquest
          of Qamus. In the evening Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said that next day
          He will give the flag to someone who loves ALLAH سبحانه وتعالى and His
          Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and ALLAH سبحانه وتعالى and His Messenger
          صلى الله عليه وسلم love him. Next day the flag was given to Ali Ibn
          Abi Talib and the fortress of Qamus fell to muslims, and subsequently
          the whole of Khyber.
          <br />
          <br />
          h). Spoils of war from Khyber included a lot of cash, crops and all
          the land both residential and agricultural. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
          distributed all these spoils among soldiers as per Quranic Command.
          Fadak, another Jew settlement around Khyber surrendered
          unconditionally without a fight. The palm orchards of Fadak thus
          categorized as Maal Fai' and Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم took over its
          possession as per Qur'anic law for leftover property of
          disbelievers/polytheists/enemies coming to Messenger صلى الله عليه
          وسلم without any fight by muslim troops. "And whatever fai' (left over
          property) Allah has passed on to His Messenger from them, you had not
          urged on your horses or camels for it, but Allah gives predominance to
          His messengers over whomsoever He wills, and Allah is Powerful over
          everything." (Surah al Hashr, Ch:59, Verse: 6,Taqi Usmani
          translation).

        hid themselves on the hills and behind the rocks on both sides of a

        unexpectedly started trying to hide from arrows and form the ranks to

        the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and companions dressed up in ehram for
        Umrah, entered in Makkah and performed Umrah. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم

        In Muharram (the first month of 9th Hijra) Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
        sent sixteen (16) Missionaries to different tribes of Arabia, inviting
        them to Islam. People started pouring into Islam, and paganism was
        erased from every corner of the Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, Prophet صلى
        الله عليه وسلم sent military platoons to different regions of Arabia for
        the establishment of security, safety and authority of Muslim state. All
        near and far idols and temples were demolished and worship of one God,
        the Almighty ALLAH, was ensured.

        a). News reached that Heraclius the Caesar of Byzantine and Ghassainds
        (Syrian Arab Christian tribes, under the rule of Byzantine) are
        preparing to invade state of Madinah and advance force has reached to
        Al-Balqa, the southern post of Byzantine Syria. Prophet صلى الله عليه
        وسلم being very precise, believed that remaining passive will encourage
        the Byzantine and Ghussainds to knock on the door of Madinah, the heart
        of Muslim state, and damage the image of its military authority.
        <br />
        <br />
        b). Consequently, Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered to begin the
        preparation for war and sent words to Makkans and other distant tribes
        to do the same. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked Muslims to come up with
        charity to organize the biggest ranks and file of troops in the history
        of Arabia. Tribes and groups from everywhere began to pour into Madinah.
        Muslim raised to donate from their wealth and property in support of the
        expedition. Uthman bin affan provided 200 saddled camels, 200 ounce
        gold, and further added 100 saddled camels and 1000 dinars. Abu Bakr
        donated all of his wealth and even household items leaving nothing for
        himself or family. Omer donated half of his money and household. Abdur
        Rahman bin Auf donated 200-ounce silver, other prosperous companions
        also donated likewise. Despite all whole hearted donations the army was
        still not properly prepared with respect to provision and mounts.
        <br />
        <br />
        c). However, thirty thousand troops left for Tabuk, a place 800 km north
        of Madinah (now a city on border of Saudi Arabia and Jordan) to face the
        Byzantine, one of the two superpowers of that time having additional
        support of Ghassanids.The Muslim army camped at Tabuk. Prophet صلى الله
        عليه وسلم delivered an eloquent speech. This speech encouraged those
        whose spirits were broken and blocked any means of suffering from lack
        of supplies and food.
        <br />
        <br />
        d). Upon learning about the march of Muslim army, the Byzantine and
        their allies became so terrified that instead of daring to set out to
        fight they scattered within their territory. This gave an enormous boost
        to the reputation of Muslim forces, establishing their capability to
        reach far corners of Arabia. The expedition results came with political
        gain as well, northern and north eastern Arabian Tribes surrendered to
        the political authority of Muslim state. Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and
        His army returned victorious from Tabuk in Ramadan of 9th Hijra.

        pilgrims ALLAH یٰ تعال و سبحانہ sent revelation, few verses of Surah

        stood at al-Jamrah in valley of Mina, read aloud to all the pilgrims and
        declared the cancellation of treaties with the idolaters, and gave them
