        <p>
          The foundational and primary belief of all the Muslims is "kalima
          ash-shahadah" or "Shahadah" (testimony) is as under:
        </p>
        <p className="arabic-text">
          "I bare witness that there is none worthy of Worship except ALLAH ( ),
          and I bare witness that Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first clause of this shahadah is called "Shahadah Tawhid"
          (Testimony to the Oneness of ALLAH ) and the second clause is
          "Shahadah Risalah" (Testimony to the Messengership of Prophet Muhammad
          ). Meaning that, as many commandments as were revealed by ALLAH to
          Muhammad , the Messenger of ALLAH includes including Prophetic Sunnah
          & Tradition, A believer believes as it is.

        <p>
          Scholars have further elaborated these articles in the light of
          Qur'an, Hadith and Sunnah, so that every Muslim can understand and
          accept them.
        </p>

        <h4>a) Faith in ALLAH ( )</h4>
        <p>
          i). First, faith in ALLAH . The first and most important basic belief
          is that we believe in ALLAH . Believe in what ALLAH and the Messenger
          Muhammad have told us, that is, let us believe with our heart and
          confess with our tongue that ALLAH is one, He is eternal and will
          always be, He is not in need of anyone, and all things are in need of
          Him. All His attributes are good, and He is the Savior of us from all
          evil, He is capable of all things, He hears and sees, He knows
          everything hidden and open, He does not die, He does not sleep. , the
          world and all the things of the world were extinct before, ALLAH
          created them by His Intention and Will and He destroys them when He
          wills, He speaks, He has no partner or partners, there is no one like
          Him. , He has no mother and father, and He has no children, He is free
          from all these physical relations.
        </p>

        <p>
          He is the King of the whole world, no one is outside of His command,
          nor is anything beyond His power, He is kind to His servants, He
          creates, and He gives death, He saves His servants from all
          calamities. And He is the Honorable, the Magnificent, the Forgiver of
          sins, the Mighty, the Giver of abundance, the Provider of sustenance
          for whomever He wills, He can restrict the sustenance of whomever He
          wills, He will be generous to whomever He wills, He will honor
          whomever He wishes. He humiliates whomever he wants, He raise up
          whomever he wants.
        </p>

        <h4>ii). Attributes of ALLAH</h4>
        <p>
          There is no attribute similar to creation in the Creator, and no
          attribute similar to the Creator is found in the creation. At some
          places in the Qur'an and Hadith, such things have been reported which
          give apprehensions of resemblance with creations., so we leave their
          meanings to ALLAH and His Messenger Muhammad . We surrender that He
          knows the truth of it and we should believe with faith without
          digging, and this is better, or else some appropriate meaning should
          be attached to it so that it becomes understandable, as the later
          scholars have given such meanings. But such "appropriate meaning" must
          be considered a tool for understanding and should not be taken for
          dictionary/literal meaning. ALLAH is above and beyond of all of our
          words and understandings.
        </p>

        <h4>iii). Nothing binds ALLAH</h4>
        <p>
          Nothing is Compulsory or a binding upon ALLAH . Whatever He gives is
          just His Merci, Whatever He pleases is His grace.
        </p>

        <h4>iv). Unbearable Suffering:</h4>
        <p>
          ALLAH did not order to do the acts which could not be performed by the
          servants.

        <p>
          The Muslim who saw Prophet is in the state of emaan (Believe & Faith)
          is called Sahabi. It is obligatory upon muslims of any era/generation
          that if any quarrel among Sahaba (Plural of Sahabi) comes to his
          hearing, he should consider it as his own misunderstanding instead of
          thinking evil in respect of Companions. The most famous among
          companions are following, Abu Bakr Siddiq was whom Muslims elected as
          first Successor after the Prophet's departure to Heavenly life. Hence,
          he is called the First Righteous Caliph. He is the Best of the
          Humankind after The Prophets and Messengers is. Second Righteous
          Caliph Is Omer ibn Khatab was Third Righteous Caliph Is Othman ibn
          Affaan was and the Fourth Righteous Caliph Is Ali ibn Abi Talib was.

    content: (
      <>
        <h4>1. TWO PRINCIPLES: -</h4>
        <p>
          a) Whatever the Holy Prophet has taught His Ummah regarding the
          Beliefs and Actions, not a single word or opinion can be added or
          subtracted.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) Regarding ALLAH ALMIGHTY's Essence, Being, Nature and Attributes
          and other beliefs, It is obligatory to believe in what has been
          narrated in Qur'an or what has been proven from Muta'Watir
          (extensively reported) Hadiths of Prophet , a minimum standard of
          extensive reports is more than 10 narrators in each era/generation.
          Moreover, whatever Prophet has explained in brief or in detail, and to
          the extent that he has interpreted it, it is obligatory to believe in
          it. It is not right to further dive down and interpret using the
          intellect, an act for which we are not compelled by the Shariah.
        </p>
        <p>
          c) These two principles are so clear that a believer doesn't need any
          further argument for the affirmation of his Beliefs Creeds and
          Actions. The Nature and Attributes of ALLAH are the topics where
          negation or affirmation solely through the intellect is impossible.
          These limits are beyond intellect's reach. Hence, there is a need for
          us to believe in Prophetic elaboration and clarification which
          satisfies the general need of all human beings, and only Prophet
          correctly understands the level of information and knowledge to be
          communicated and educated.

          2. OPINIONS OF SOME EARLY PIOUS SCHOLARS (SALAF-AS-SALIHEEN) REGARDING
          BELIEFS AND CREEDS DEBATES
        </h4>

        <h5>a) Imam Malik ibn Anas</h5>
        <p>Explains the belief of Ah! Al-Sunnah Wal Jama'ah as follows;</p>
        <p>
          "I don't like to talk upon the topic of beliefs, scholars of my city
          (Madinah) have discouraged such discussions, such as discussing Creeds
          of Jahmiya (A strayed sect) and discussing about Destiny. I dislike
          debates upon any such topics which are not related to an action. I
          like staying quiet about the Essance and Being of ALLAH . Imam's
          statement shows that the early scholars' approach towards argument was
          more practical than imagination.

        <h4>3. SUBJECT OF DESTINY, OPPRESSION OR FREE WILL</h4>
        <p>
          First ever debates in Beliefs and Creeds started upon this issue. This
          is an issue that is difficult to answer not only in religion but also
          in the philosophy. It is not only the Islam, but no religion in the
          world is free from debates on it. In fact, the spirit of religion is
          hidden within this miraculous puzzle, answering it in an absolutely
          negative or positive tone, with claiming arguments is a dangerous
          attack on religion.
