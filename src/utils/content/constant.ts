(Chapter 15 (Surah Al-Hijr), verse 9)\n\n"(O Prophet), do not move your tongue (during revelation) for (reciting) it (The Quran) to receive in hurry. O It is surely undertaken by us to store it (in your heart), and to let it be recited (by you) after revelation is completed." (Chapter 75 (Surah Al-Qiyamah), verses 16-17)\n\nQur'an was revealed in parts and with intervals as deemed appropriate by THE ALMIGHTY ALLAH, and, so as to be preserved in the heart of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) for onward easy preaching of people.\n\n"Said those who disbelieved, 'why has the Qur'an not been revealed to him at once?' (it has been sent down) in this way (i.e. in parts) so that we make your heart firm, and we revealed it little by little." (Chapter 25 (Surah Al-Furqan), verse 32)\n\n"We have divided the Qur'an in portions, so that you may recite it to the people gradually, and we have revealed it little by little." (Chapter 17 (Surah Bani Israil), verse 106)`,

And no one rejects our verses except the wrongdoers." (Chapter 29 (Surah Al-Ankabut), verse 49).\n\nDisbelievers besides many other efforts to oppose the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and Qur'an, also use to propagate that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has got some scripture from old times people written for him. Quran says it below:\n\n"And they said, '(These are) the tales of the ancients he (the messenger) has caused to be written and they are read out to him at morning and evening'." (Chapter 25 (Surah Al-Furqan), verse 5))\n\n"Say: This has been sent down by Him, who knows the secrets within the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is All Forgiving, All Merciful."

Those who were appointed to learn by heart, they learn it by heart and those designated to write, immediately write the new verses. The order and placement of chapters and verses also revealed by THE ALMIGHTY ALLAH through Archangel Gabriel (Peace be upon Him). A Musnad Ahmed's hadith describes the process narrated in under mention hadith of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم):\n\nInterpretation of Hadith: Archangel Gabriel (Peace be upon Him) arrived and told me to put this verse in this chapter at that position.\n\nMoreover, Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) after writing down of revelation immediately asked to read that back, so as to confirm the text is written correctly.\n\nDuring Mecca time before hijra normally besides some others, Sayyidina Othman Ghani and Sayyidina Ali ibn Abi Talib (May ALLAH be pleased with them) were the designated earliest writers.\n\nLater then on, after hijra when proper institution of writing revelation was established in Madinah Munawara, many officially designated companions (May ALLAH be pleased with them) performed this duty.\n\nThe head of this institute was Hanzalah Bin Rabi (May ALLAH be pleased with him). Number of other members of institution are reported as 42. Never the less, this number used to fluctuate as per requirements and availability of Qur'an writers.`,

This incident provoked Sayyidina Umer Ibn Khattab (May ALLAH be pleased with him) to request first righteous caliph to compile the Qur'an in one book form, from written manuscript available with companions in the form of individual chapters.

Banu Huzail (Hazali tribe) recite alphabet "Ha" as "Aa", such as pronouncing phrase "Hatta Hein" as "Atta Aein".\n\nii. Banu Asad for example recite "Teilamun" instead of "Ta'lamün"\n\niii. Ansar of Madina used to recite word "Taboot" as "Tabüh".\n\niv. Qais tribe replace alphabet "Kaaf" with "Sheen".\n\nv. Tamim tribe pronounce word "Ün" as "A'an".\n\nvi.

Some areas recite alphabet "Qauf" as "Kha" and some recite it as "Kä" even the name "Qur'an" is written with the two differences, it would appear as, "Khur'an" or "Kur'an".\n\nHence if each group of people had started writing in their indigenous accents using alphabets of their own, we might have had found thousands of different written/printed Qur'ans now and none of these group of people could be able to recite the copy of Qur'an of any other group.\n\nNote: All material except Paragraph No. 5 & 6 is taken from "Tadween-e-Qur'an" of Mawlana Syed Manazir Ahsan Gilani.

        subDescription: `a) Some such incidents came into notice of caliphate government that people due to difference in accent and dialect even named each other the kafir (non-believers).\n\nb) First companion who raised the issue to third righteous caliph was Hudaifa bin Yamaan (May ALLAH be pleased with him).\n\nc) Sayyidina Othman Ghani (May ALLAH be pleased with him) brought forward the issue in front a board of senior companions (May ALLAH be pleased with them).\n\nd) Ali ibn Abi Talib (May ALLAH be pleased with him) says that Othman Ghani (May ALLAH be pleased with him) did right, and whatever he decided to address the issue decided with our consent and advice. Caliph Othman Ghani (May ALLAH be pleased with him) asked the board for solution. The Board in turn asked the caliph's opinion. The Caliph said that he believes to bring the people on a standardized script. The board agreed unanimously and caliph Othman Ghani (May ALLAH be pleased with him) constituted a commission under the chairmanship of Zaid bin Sabit (May ALLAH be pleased with him) who was the head of commission for compilation of Qur'an during first caliph times.\n\ne) Caliph Othman Ghani (May ALLAH be pleased with him) ordered that Qur'an shall be written in accent, dialect and alphabets of tribe of Madhar as it was revealed upon a Madhari Arab (The Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم)).\n\nf) It is worth mentioning that Arabs at Macro scale were divided as two elementary tribes. Northern 2/3 of Arabs were Madhari and Southern 1/3 was Yamani. The further downward division as Quraish, Thaqif, Hawazin (examples of Madhari such tribes) and Azdi, Dausi (Yamani such tribes) was the sub division of greater Madhari and Yamani tribes.\n\ng) Finally, the official volume of Qur'an written in the accent and dialect of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), completed. Later on, copies of this Qur'an were made and sent to every governorate with instruction to discard all previous copies.\n\nh) After this Qur'an, up to written script become one and standard, approved and accepted by all companions (May ALLAH be pleased with them) of Prophet Muhammad (Blessings and peace be upon him).\n\ni) This effort standardized Qur'an as single scripture with fixed alphabet. As we narrated earlier the Qur'an had already been compiled in one volume during first caliph times in order of verses and chapters as described by Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).`,

  preface: `QURAN, the revelation from Almighty Allah, is the first primary source of Shari’ah to be
Complied. Hadith and Sunnah (Prophetic Traditions) from Prophet Muhammad ()
is the second primary source to understand and follow the Devine Commands. There are
secondary sources as well, like al Ijma (Consensus), al Qiyas (Legal Analogy), which are parts
of Fiqh (Jurisprudence) but not our subject here. ${'\n'}
How this tradition has been preserved and researched to use in every walk of life is an example
in itself, as no other religion can produce such work as their Prophetic traditions.
Consequently, a lot of stuff available not only for Scholars (Ul’ama, Orientalists) but for general
reader as well. Following is a brief introduction to the Science of Hadith, it’s Principles and
Terminologies etc.`
